# Table_Plank_problem
(Physics) A plank stacking problem

This is a really interesting physics problem which is related to stacking of cards (planks) on top of each other on a table.
The idea is to stack the cards with maximum portion of them coming out of the table without making the structure to fall. A center of mass of
the entire stack has to be just inside the table boudries. 

Let's start from one card of length L. The card can be placed on the table with half of the length hanging out. Now place another card on
below this on the table. The second card can be moved out untilt the CoM of the the two card stack remains inside the boudries of table.
Repeating this problem for n cards will give us an interesting shape similar to a parabola.

This is the simulation done for 10 cards. See just for 10 cards the last card is actually completely out of the table and the whole system
is in equilubrium. Thank you physics.
